                    The history of kylie is as vast as it is mysterious. There is much that we don't know about her 
                    species, but through the dedicated work of archeologists and volunteer researchers, we have pieced
                    together what we believe to be a somewhat comprehensive chronology. Let's first take a brief look
                    at the history of her evolution.
                </div>
                <h1>Evolution</h1>
                The exact origin of Kylies is unknown. Her species is very ancient, but we have estimated that the very first
                Kylie existed around 5000 B.C.E. Follow her evolution using the timeline below.
                <h1>Habitats</h1>
                <p>
                    Due to the ever changing landscape of the earth due to urbanization, the amount of natural habitats a wild 
                    Kylie may inhabit are dwindling. She has, rather remarkably, adapted to her changing environment. She can be found
                    in college campuses, often enjoying the vast amount of knowledge held there (Kylies are very drawn to academia) or
                    lounging by large bodies of water, such as a pool or a beach.
                </p>
                <h1>Dietary Habits</h1>
                <p>
                    The diet of a wild Kylie is, unsurprisingly, influcenced by the habitats in which she is most comfortable. 
                    Most commonly omnivores, Kylies enjoy high-protien and high-energy food to support her active lifestyle.
                    Common sources of this food are Chick-Fil-A and Chipotle. They may also be found
                    near watering holes such as Dutch Bros, or drinking portable beverages such as Celcius.
                </p>
                <h1>Natural Predators</h1>
                <p>
                    The average specemin of a Kylie faces few natural predators. 
                    They are generally incredibly fast and observant, making it hard to catch her off guard.
                    She is also well-muscled and ferocious, so she faces few natural predators.
                    Surprisingly, though there are only three observed instances of one of her species ever being harmed by a creature of this kind,
                    Kylies show great caution around any insect. She is especially jittered by flying insects, which incites an intense
                    and instant reaction. If you ever find a Kylie running with wild abandon, break out the insect repellant.
